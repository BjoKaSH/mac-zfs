MacZFS is a community effort to prolong the life of ZFS on Mac OS X,
since the Apple Open Source project was shut down. It is supported on
both Leopard (Intel/PPC) and Snow Leopard (Intel 32-bit and 64-bit)
platforms, although it may require Snow Leopard in order to build.
Preview support for Lion is included.

Backups
=======

Please note that all software is known to contain bugs. Whilst care
has been taken to ensure that under normal operations things don't
go wrong, there's no guarantee of that fact. Using kernel extensions
introduce a degree of instability into a system that userland 
processes don't encounter; the software has been known to cause
kernel panics in the past. In addition, any file system has the
possibility of causing damage to files; whilst ZFS creates checksums
of all blocks (and so can detect failure earlier than in other systems)
there's no guarantee that your data will be accessible in the event
of problems. You should therefore take full responsiblity of backups
of data in the event that a restoration is needed. Any single filing
system, including ZFS, is not a substitute for backups.
